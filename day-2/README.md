# Day 2 ‚Äì RTL Workshop: Libraries, Synthesis, and Flip-Flops

This module covers three pillars of RTL design:

- **Timing Libraries (.lib):** Understanding PVT impact.
- **Synthesis Approaches:** Hierarchical vs. flat.
- **Flip-Flop Coding:** Efficient sequential logic design.

Throughout the guide, you‚Äôll find placeholders to add images/screenshots (replace the `![Alt Text](image-link)` with your uploaded links).

## 1. Timing Libraries and PVT Corners

The SKY130 PDK provides `.lib` files describing delay, area, and power of standard cells.

**Example:** `sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib`
- `tt` ‚Üí Typical process corner
- `025C` ‚Üí Temperature at 25¬∞C
- `1v80` ‚Üí Voltage of 1.8 V

üëâ These libraries ensure synthesis reflects real-world PVT behavior.

### üìä Cell Variants and Trade-offs

For cells like AND2, AND2_2, AND2_4:
- **Area ‚¨ÜÔ∏è** with higher drive strength.
- **Delay ‚¨áÔ∏è** with higher drive strength.

## 2. Synthesis Approaches

## Hierarchical Synthesis

- **Definition:** Retains the module hierarchy as defined in RTL, synthesizing modules separately.
- **How it Works:** Tools like Yosys process each module independently, using the `hierarchy` command to analyze and set up the design structure.

**Advantages:**
- Faster synthesis time for large designs.
- Improved debugging and analysis due to maintained module boundaries.
- Modular approach, aiding integration with other tools.

**Disadvantages:**
- Cross-module optimizations are limited.
- Reporting can require additional configuration.

## Flattened Synthesis

- **Definition:** Merges all modules into a single flat netlist, eliminating hierarchy.
- **How it Works:** The `flatten` command in Yosys collapses the hierarchy, allowing whole-design optimizations.

**Advantages:**
- Enables aggressive, cross-module optimizations.
- Results in a unified netlist, sometimes simplifying downstream processes.

**Disadvantages:**
- Longer runtime for large designs.
- Loss of hierarchy complicates debugging and reporting.
- Can increase memory usage and netlist complexity.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Trade-offs Table

| Aspect      | Hierarchical      | Flattened        |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ---------------  |
| Debugging   | Easier           | Harder           |
| Optimization| Local/module-level| Global           |
| Runtime     | Faster (large SoCs)| Slower          |
| Area/Delay  | May be larger     | Optimized        |

#### Practical Notes

- **Total synthesis:** Stacked NMOS perform better than stacked PMOS.
- **Single-module synthesis:** Efficient when one block repeats many times.
- `synth -top <module>`: Defines which module is synthesized.

## 3. Flip-Flop Coding Styles

**Asynchronous Reset DFF**
```verilog
always @(posedge clk, posedge reset)
  if (reset) q <= 1'b0;
  else       q <= d;
```

**Asynchronous Set DFF**
```verilog
always @(posedge clk, posedge set)
  if (set)   q <= 1'b1;
  else       q <= d;
```

**Synchronous Reset DFF**
```verilog
always @(posedge clk)
  if (reset) q <= 1'b0;
  else       q <= d;
```


## 4. Simulation & Synthesis Flow

### A. Simulation with Icarus + GTKWave
```shell
iverilog dff_asyncres.v tb_dff_asyncres.v
./a.out
gtkwave tb_dff_asyncres.vcd
```
<img width="1920" height="922" alt="async res" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf5f64f5-b186-4882-ac23-5bd76a2e2a62" />

For Async set:
```shell
iverilog dff_async_set.v tb_dff_asyncres.v
./a.out
gtkwave tb_dff_asyn_set.vcd
```
<img width="1920" height="922" alt="d asy set" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ed382e8-93af-4cac-aec9-bba5c4ac288f" />




### B. Synthesis with Yosys
```shell
yosys
read_liberty -lib ../sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
read_verilog dff_asyncres.v
synth -top dff_asyncres
dfflibmap -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
abc -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
show
```

**Observing multiplication code**
`gvim mult_*.v -o`
you see something like
<img width="1920" height="922" alt="mult" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6405a76-52e1-4b56-b385-f0080090892f" />

1.Here you can see that by multiplying with 2 we just add a zero in it's binary ones place.(zero is appended)
now follow the previous steps to see netlist in yosys
<img width="1920" height="922" alt="mlu2 yosys" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3b37068-dea6-4cc4-af7e-4a499c833ae4" />

2.when multiplied by nine we get a same number repeated 2 times in it;s binary. You can check the yosys netlist

## ‚úÖ Summary

- `.lib` files capture PVT conditions and cell performance.
- Larger cells ‚Üí more area, less delay.
- Hierarchical vs. Flat synthesis = modular debugging vs. global optimization.
- Flip-flops: code carefully depending on reset/set requirements.
- Use `synth -top` to control entry module for synthesis.
